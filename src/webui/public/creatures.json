The ideal lair for a blue dragon contains multiple passages, rooms, and secret chambers.

But despite their incredible power, gold dragons are fond of discourse and prefer to talk through solutions to problems rather than rely upon brute strength. Long-lived as they are, they necessarily take a wide view of all situations and never act without considering all possible options and outcomes. Because of this, gold dragons willingly converse with any creature that seeks them out, even evil chromatic dragons. Mortals might find this behavior strange, considering the longstanding war between chromatic and metallic dragons, but dragons know all too well that desperate situations sometimes call for drastic alliances. And although gold dragons might consider brief truces with their chromatic brethren in the case of world-ending threats, they also know when such alliances have run their course.

Their intellect and wisdom is such that they prefer to ponder the great questions of life in seclusion, where they strive to formulate solutions to the world's most pressing problems. As a result, gold dragons are sometimes absent when metallic dragons gather together, or are missing from tribunals where their counsel would be beneficial. Impatient dragons sometimes begrudge gold dragons for this apparent unreliability, but such aspersions are usually a result of jealousy rather than any true criticism; in their hearts, other dragons know that few gold dragons purposefully exclude themselves from truly important matters.

The zeal with which they seek out, confront, and defeat evil is unsurpassed even among their metallic cousins, and they adhere to strict codes of honor usually passed down from parent to hatchling. On occasion, they instead learn these codes from trusted mentors, usually other silver dragons or gold dragons. As they age, they become even more dedicated to their codes, often adding new and even more restrictive clauses to the systems that guide their behavior. Silver dragons are incredibly altruistic and regularly consort with the citizens of goodly societies, of which they consider themselves protectors and guides. In addition to responding to evil threats, silver dragons work to prevent evil from taking root in the first place, and they ensure mortals under their care are well fed, educated, and treated with dignity. Although silver dragons can seem overzealous or even eager to join the fight against evil, they know that the best way to rid the world of corruption is to stamp out strife and disillusionment at their source, not to passively sit back and watch it grow into an unsolvable problem. Silver dragons can be vindictive, but they can also be forgiving; for evildoers who seek to atone for their sins and turn over a new leaf, the support of a silver dragon is both unwavering and invaluable. Many silver dragons are also drawn to religious endeavors, venerating deities such as Iomedae, Sarenrae, and other deities concerned with justice, virtue, and redemption.Recall Knowledge - Dragon (Arcana): DC 32Adult Silver Dragon","image_url":"","origin":""},{"name":"Adult Sky Dragon","family":"Dragon, Sky","level":13,"alignment":"Lawful Good","creature_type":"Dragon","size":"Huge","traits":["Dragon","Electricity"],"rarity":"Uncommon","id":"Monsters.aspx?ID=1129","lore":"Adult Sky DragonSky dragons live above the clouds near the summits of mountains.

Dwelling on glacial mountaintops or in ice caverns beneath forbidding tundra, they treat the lands around them as their own personal hunting grounds. They fly out to feed or terrorize other creatures, especially those who trespass near the dragon’s territory, then bring any treasure back to be displayed in icy niches in their lairs.

In these cases, the brine dragon is quick to step in and aid in the defense of their community.Although brine dragons enjoy cultivating settlements, they rarely make their lairs within the city limits, instead preferring to dwell in sea caves or cliffside grottoes overlooking the coastline. Here they can retreat for privacy as needed, or can accumulate and display their gathered wealth in a place where they feel safe spreading out their treasures.

Bronze dragons are principled and protective, but while their silver cousins are quick to crusade for justice, bronze dragons prefer to find an important location worthy of their protection and guard it against any attack or unwelcome intrusion. Bronze dragons’ mastery over water and affinity for electricity means they are a boon to sailors caught in thunderstorms. A bronze dragon’s enemies quickly discover neither cloudy sky nor turbulent sea provides shelter from their wrath. Bronze dragons lair along shorelines, often in partially submerged sea caves. While all dragons keep hoards of treasure, the hoard of a bronze dragon more resembles a vast library—with the shelves kept carefully above the waterline, of course.

They keep lairs among the extreme altitudes of the highest mountain peaks but are away on their many journeys as often as they're at home. Cloud dragons spend long hours surveying the lands they fly over from great heights, but they are creatures of whim, making it hard to predict what will pique their curiosity and bring them winging down to converse or investigate something on the ground. Cloud dragons seldom perform acts of outright malice, but they are not often charitable either. A cloud dragon is as likely to simply pluck something they desire off the ground and fly away with it as they are to bargain fairly.A cloud dragon's ever-changing interests never seem to stray toward the complicated schemes and long-term plans of other dragons. These rovers are creatures of the moment, and although they are as mentally gifted as other true dragons, their interests remain in the here and now. Yet the cloud dragon's penchant for living in the moment is not a personality flaw—they're more than capable of anticipating long-term results of their actions and won't make foolish choices simply to pursue a current interest. At the same time, cloud dragons have little interest in worrying about the future and are as confident in their ability to handle tomorrow's problems as they are today's.Cloud dragon hoards tend to be well-guarded or well-hidden, as a natural result of their roving habits often taking them away from their lairs for extended periods.

Copper dragons are hedonists who are quick to indulge in simple pleasures, but they’re also sympathetic to other creatures, slow to pass judgment, and careful to always examine a situation from as many perspectives as possible. This philosophy has its drawbacks, however, as copper dragons are susceptible to negative influences and prone to forgiving the less serious evil acts performed by their chromatic cousins and other cruel creatures. Copper dragons also have a difficult time keeping their temper in check once they are roused to anger. Copper dragons tend to lair in warm or temperate hills, but due to their nature, they move their lairs every few years. They sometimes live among other people, especially any dwarves who reside nearby. Some copper dragons even worship gods typically worshipped only by humanoids. Among these dragons, worship of Cayden Cailean is most popular, as they see his love of freedom and penchant for alcohol aligning with the typical copper dragon mindset.

Although their opinions are changeable, crystal dragons prefer orderly environments and are not fond of sudden interruptions or distractions.Crystal dragons build their lairs in underground grottoes, where they cultivate environments of great beauty. Their exacting standards and vivid imaginations mean that they are always working to improve the appearance or layout of some part of their lair. These lairs are unique to each individual crystal dragon, but there are always plenty of reflective surfaces that allow the dragon to observe their own appearance. These range from crystals to reflecting pools to finely crafted mirrors, which are arranged throughout the lair in a pleasing array. Gifts of well-crafted or magical mirrors are an excellent way to curry favor with a crystal dragon.Although crystal dragons are easily distracted by their sparkling collections or their vanity, they remain good-hearted creatures at the core and make friends quickly.

They command the unwavering reverence of all other metallic dragons, who view gold dragons as their leaders and counselors. Golds rival the raw power of even red dragons, much to the chagrin of their chromatic cousins, and the two races are often regarded as bitter rivals. But despite their incredible power, gold dragons are fond of discourse and prefer to talk through solutions to problems rather than rely upon brute strength. Long-lived as they are, they necessarily take a wide view of all situations and never act without considering all possible options and outcomes. Because of this, gold dragons willingly converse with any creature that seeks them out, even evil chromatic dragons. Mortals might find this behavior strange, considering the longstanding war between chromatic and metallic dragons, but dragons know all too well that desperate situations sometimes call for drastic alliances. And although gold dragons might consider brief truces with their chromatic brethren in the case of world-ending threats, they also know when such alliances have run their course. When another metallic dragon faces a quandary or a foe beyond its own ability to overcome, its best option is often to seek the counsel of the eternally wise and gloriously righteous gold dragons. Locating these legendary beings is no easy task, however, for gold dragons are notoriously reclusive. Their intellect and wisdom is such that they prefer to ponder the great questions of life in seclusion, where they strive to formulate solutions to the world's most pressing problems. As a result, gold dragons are sometimes absent when metallic dragons gather together, or are missing from tribunals where their counsel would be beneficial. Impatient dragons sometimes begrudge gold dragons for this apparent unreliability, but such aspersions are usually a result of jealousy rather than any true criticism; in their hearts, other dragons know that few gold dragons purposefully exclude themselves from truly important matters. A gold dragon's incredible foresight and unparalleled enlightenment means they are unlikely to interfere in the business of individual mortals, though the rare person who captures the attention of a gold dragon is fortunate indeed, for there are few beings in the cosmos who can offer such prudent and considerate advice. Rulers and individuals in stations of high power have an easier time of garnering the aid of a gold dragon; entire wars have been avoided thanks to a gold dragon's last-minute intermediation. Gold dragons are often found in warm grasslands and savannas, lands where they can enjoy long, meditative flights without attracting the attention of potential enemies. They tend to sleep either out in the open in a barren, remote place, or within a heavily secreted or fortified lair, such as a forgotten sink hole or in the labyrinthine caverns of a terrestrial chasm. Gold dragons may enlist trusted servants and allies to guard their lairs, though many live truly solitary lives, preferring to protect their hoards with nonlethal traps and magical wards.Recall Knowledge - Dragon (Arcana): DC 42Ancient Gold Dragon","image_url":"Images\\Monsters\\DragonGold_AncientGoldDragon.png","origin":""},{"name":"Ancient Green Dragon","family":"Dragon, Green","level":17,"alignment":"Lawful Evil","creature_type":"Dragon","size":"Gargantuan","traits":["Amphibious","Dragon"],"rarity":"Uncommon","id":"Monsters.aspx?ID=135","lore":"Ancient Green DragonGreen dragons are the most contemplative of the chromatic dragons as well as the most approachable.

Like most chromatic dragons, green dragons do not suffer fools—and the threshold for what they consider foolish is very low. Though more open than their chromatic cousins to dealing with other creatures and dragons, green dragons prefer an isolated and quiet life. They tend to lair in the most forbidding parts of a forest, surrounded by tangled thickets, or else at the heart of some dismal gulch. If the terrain is suitable, some green dragons make their home in natural caves, which they expand to suit their needs. Green dragons’ pride leads them to see to the preservation of their forest homes. They feel that a verdant and lush forest is something that they alone have cultivated. This leads some green dragons to follow the path of druidism, though most prefer to study the arcane arts and occult lore. Most of them delve deeply into one particular field of study, and correspond with other scholars in the field by adopting a pen name that hides their true nature. Regardless of their chosen focus, green dragons seek to improve themselves, and their desire for knowledge makes them more likely to deal diplomatically with other creatures in order to obtain new information. Their hoards are typically well kept, organized, and filled with tomes of lore and scrolls of magic along with antiquities they collect for their own inscrutable reasons.

Many azers take pride in their ancestral roles and in fulfilling their inherited duties, providing needed services within their communities. Long ago, traditional azer values of self-sufficiency and close community led them to build mighty fortresses across the Plane of Fire, where they isolated themselves from other planar denizens and even other azer communities. These values, sadly, also led to their downfall. Without any connections to or regular communication with other settlements, these fortresses were easily conquered by the efreet of the City of Brass, the dominant power on the Plane of Fire.

Folklore holds that, much like for the cockatrice, the first basilisks hatched from leathery eggs laid by snakes and incubated by roosters, but little in the basilisk’s physiology lends any credence to this claim. A basilisk prefers to eat petrified flesh. Once a victim has been turned to stone, the basilisk crunches the fossilized corpse with its powerful jaws and lets its potent stomach acids do the rest. This digestive process is extremely slow and inefficient, causing the basilisk to move so lethargically that it appears as if in mid-petrification itself. This has even led to the saying “as slow as a well-fed basilisk.” Certainly basilisks are well-known for their slow gait and slothful nature, but a predator that can turn its prey to stone with a glance hardly has much need for speed. An adult basilisk is 13 feet long from head to tail and weighs roughly 300 pounds. These reptiles make hissing sounds when moving about that turns to a guttural gurgle when they’re agitated. Though they are normally solitary creatures that come together only to mate and lay eggs, there are periodic reports of regions being infested with unusual numbers of basilisks.

For unknown reasons, weasels and ferrets are immune to the basilisk’s stare, and they sometimes sneak into basilisk lairs while a parent is hunting in order to consume eggs or freshly hatched young.

Their eyes emit a soft glow at all times, but a blindheim can draw back the heavy membrane that normally covers them to emit an intense light as bright as day. These simple creatures use their lights to draw in or disorient prey, mostly small animals like lizards, rodents, or fish. However, they might go after larger prey if trying to feed their young. When they encounter creatures their own size or larger they retreat, flashing their eyes to facilitate their escape if necessary. They often hunt in pairs or small packs. Using their lights to coordinate from a distance, they slowly close in on the creatures they hunt. One common hunting pattern involves one blindheim diving deep and using its light to chase fish to the surface, while another up above snatches them up and tosses them onto the land to eat later.Blindheims make their nests in damp caverns, especially grottoes next to underground lakes or bogs. An ideal nest rests in a cozy cavern with plenty of fungus to eat, a few fish swimming in a lake, and the comforting drip of water from the ceiling. Blindheims prefer to lead quiet and serene lives, and even when first born they emit only the meekest of vocalizations. A blindheim is born shining, and its parents cuddle over it to dim the light so as to avoid attracting predators.It's not just animals that endanger blindheims. Underground peoples find the creatures useful and attempt to capture them for specialized purposes. Duergars use them as “raid frogs,” placing heavy hoods over blindheims' heads and revealing them suddenly during raids to blind their foes. They sometimes send the creatures along with their slaves that lack darkvision into the mines as a source of light. Drow use them for some of these same purposes, and some nobles have been known to treat the creatures as mere lanterns, having them hoisted to the ceilings of their halls.

While they have no innate ability to travel to the Ethereal Plane for extended periods of time, all blink dogs constantly shimmer and ripple between the Material Plane and the Ethereal. They do their best to use their ability to blink to snatch glimpses into the Ethereal Plane and keep track of potential threats that might be building there, but in practice this tactic yields more of a constant stream of hunches and estimations of Ethereal-based threats. Of course, to a blink dog, this constant state of flux is as natural as breathing.Pack leadership always falls to a pair—an elder blink dog (called an alpha) who relies upon the valued guidance of a trusted pack mate (the sage). Honor and tradition are keystones of blink dog society. They are fiercely loyal, defending the pack or creatures they befriend to the death and maintaining oaths handed down from litter to litter. Though different packs hold different traditions and oaths, their connection through the tales and stories told among their kind and the shared experience of the movement of stars above weave all blink dogs into an extended family, a great pack. Through their myths and folklore, blink dogs have names for celestial phenomena, note births under auspicious stars, and read omens from unusual stellar conjunctions. These celestial signs are woven into blink dogs' lifeways; their names contain a reference to the specific constellation under which they were born, and a pack's sage watches the heavens for signs to help them decide when a pup is old enough for their first hunt.Recall Knowledge - Beast (Arcana, Nature): DC 18Blink Dog","image_url":"Images\\Monsters\\BlinkDog.png","origin":""},{"name":"Blizzardborn","family":"Elemental, Water","level":6,"alignment":"Neutral","creature_type":"Elemental","size":"Medium","traits":["Cold","Elemental","Water"],"rarity":"Common","id":"Monsters.aspx?ID=665","lore":"BlizzardbornFreezing and thawing in a near-constant loop, blizzardborn resemble humanoid forms composed of a mixture of partially melted snow and sleet.

Farmers curse the creatures for sucking their livestock dry. It is from such beleaguered people that the bloodseeker's regional name “stirge,” possibly a corruption of the word “scourge,” comes. Folk wisdom holds that the appearance of bloodseekers in a region signals a healthy herd of livestock, but more often it means bogs or old buildings that haven't been properly tended to. Certainly, no amount of folksy parable can assuage a farmer driven to destitution by a bloodseeker infestation. But despite their role as parasites, bloodseekers aren't hated by all villages. In some cases, the inhabitants of remote backwoods thorps even keep the things as pets or use them as doubtful medicinal “tools” to drain away unwanted humors or test for evil spirits possessing the blood. Worshippers of gods of pestilence and parasites often view bloodseekers as sacred to their faith and allow the creatures to feed freely from their bodies. In such societies, those who accidentally give too much are considered to have been “blessed” by the village's hungry god. Bloodseekers seem to be constantly hungry, but they are not inherently malevolent. They can be scared away fairly easily and prefer to swiftly retreat rather than risk death. Some adventurers report that these creatures can be scared away by waving torches at the flying pests. However, bloodseekers are much bolder when encountered in larger numbers, as bringing down one victim lets an entire colony feed. Bloodseeker colonies are called clots, for obvious and disgusting reasons. If a lone bloodseeker finds a likely victim while its clot is nearby, it emits a high-pitched, keening noise to summon reinforcements. Most humanoids avoid bloodseekers, but boggards sometimes cultivate bloodseeker nests around the perimeter of their territory. These colonies serve as a deterrent to intruders, and the boggards sometimes check for bloodseeker prey, collecting the hides or bodies of animals killed by the pests. Meals prepared from slain bloodseekers that have gorged on the blood of specific creatures are a staple among certain boggard communities. The boggards not only eat the actual bloodseekers, but they also make a gelled slurry from the drained blood. A typical bloodseeker is about a foot long, with mottled, reddish-brown skin and a yellow underbelly. Its four wings resemble bat wings.

These desires stem from an underlying cause, either placed within the ship by its creator or accreted from the scattered final wishes of its component dead souls. For example, a deity might send a bone ship on a special mission to carry a message or dispose of a particularly persistent adversary or annoyance. Though bone ships usually travel upon the waves, they have no need to breathe and can carry out underwater missions at the behest of their creator.

When they burrow through the ground, only the fin of their thickly armored backs protrudes above—at least until they are ready to leap out and strike their prey.

When it finds an area rich in food, such as a farming village, it adds that area to its regular patrol route. Over the course of a few months, it can wipe entire settlements off the map. Bulettes are fiercely competitive creatures that battle relentlessly with other predators in their territory.

The mated pair instruct the young bulette how to hunt, teaching their spawn which creatures are easiest to kill and which creatures to avoid. The mated pair drive off their young after its first successful hunt. The first bulettes were magically created guardians, intended to serve as frightening pets for a power-hungry and sadistic wizard. The technique for their creation, as well as their original purpose, has since been lost to history, and multiple conflicting accounts of ancient texts exist with dozens of wizards claiming to have been the first inventor of the notorious beast.

Most bunyips avoid human contact, except when one wanders too close to their den or favorite hunting spot, at which point the territorial bunyip attacks with swift and terrible ferocity. Many scholars agree that a large number of unexplained disappearances near coastal areas are the result of unreported bunyip aggression.

Thriving where other animals wither and perish, camels are well-adapted to their homes with tough skin and the ability to store nutrients within their bodies. Properly cared for, these “ships of the desert” can trek for weeks between oases without trouble.  Camels have three eyelids to protect them from desert sands and other blowing debris. One lid is completely clear, which allows them to see and travel during high winds. When sandstorms strike, camels completely close their nostrils to protect their lungs. Their underbellies also sport a thick, specialized skin, allowing them to lay down safely on burning hot sands.  Contrary to popular belief, fatty tissue comprises a camel's humps rather than water. This stored energy allows the animals to survive long distances between feedings. These herbivores can also readily digest hardy scrub brush inedible to other species, making them one of the hardiest desert survivors. Strong as a warhorse, camels can run fast and even sprint for short periods of time when they feel threatened, though they prefer a slow, plodding pace to conserve energy. One-humped camels, also called dromedaries, are more common in the deserts of northern Garund, while the two-humped variety are native to the dry steppes of Casmaron.

This interest isn't very deep—it just results in chokers that like killing people and collecting any of their items that seem sophisticated, such as jewelry, nice clothing, or written texts.Chokers sometimes gather in settlements, usually sticking to slums or abandoned structures. These chokers stalk at night, flopping across rooftops, tapping at windows, and scuttling through sewers, gutters, and chimneys to get at prey. An urban choker that finds prey early on its hunt—a wandering pet, a person who is out alone—might spend the rest of the night indulging its curiosity about the products of society. A curious choker might abscond with all sorts of odd items, from tavern signs to library books to roof tiles. A choker usually pilfers only one item at a time, but as its collection grows, it might need to find a larger nest to accommodate its collection, then move its pieces one by one to the new home.Recall Knowledge - Aberration (Occultism): DC 16Choker","image_url":"Images\\Monsters\\Choker.png","origin":""},{"name":"Choral (Choir Angel)","family":"Angel","level":6,"alignment":"Neutral Good","creature_type":"Celestial","size":"Small","traits":["Angel","Celestial"],"rarity":"Common","id":"Monsters.aspx?ID=14","lore":"Choral (Choir Angel)Choral angels are incredible singers who \u001ffill the halls of Nirvana with pious chants and sacred hymns.

Members of these groups work well together, growing bold enough to attack larger animals, small herds, and otherwise more dangerous prey. Stories of chupacabras attacking travelers or laying siege to farmhouses typically stem from the hunting practices of such gangs.

Cockatrices are remarkably fecund and gather in flocks of up to a dozen members. Each flock contains only a few females.

Doppelgangers are incredibly secretive, with some nearing outright paranoia. They choose their targets carefully and go to great lengths not to reveal their intentions before their plans come to fruition. Doppelgangers usually infiltrate communities in order to gain some manner of wealth or power, and assume the guises of other (usually influential) persons to allow the creatures they’re impersonating to take the fall for any negative consequences that may result from their actions. Though most are not evil, doppelgangers are manipulative and self-serving. As they don’t have their own society and aren’t monolithic in their motivations, an individual doppelganger has its own unique interests and impulses, though many are over-indulgent. Some doppelgangers enjoy the thrill of subtlety, while others favor grander schemes, such as manipulating a nation’s political infrastructure. Others seek to exploit merchant guilds to gain immense wealth, while others use their shape-changing ability to destroy relationships between close friends or families. Doppelgangers are careful and patient creatures. They are willing to slowly construct elaborate schemes that may require extended periods of time—even decades—to yield results. Doppelgangers often work alone, as they don’t trust potential cohorts not to ruin their plans. There are rare times when doppelgangers might reveal secrets to high-ranking individuals to ensure a successful infiltration.

The drakauthix’s digestive process is entirely external—it clings to victims, and its spore-laden surface slowly feeds on and grows through the flesh before the spore-infested carcass is discarded. As the infested body strikes the ground below, it bursts and releases a cloud of spores, unleashing a host of young called sporelings that immediately scuttle up the cavern walls to cling to its ceiling and grow. The drakauthix behaves no more intelligently than most predatory animals, and often uses a sort of symbiotic scavenger method to secure prey by capitalizing on the hunting methods of oozes and vermin found in the large cave systems it frequents. When a relatively mindless creature kills a victim, the drakauthix drifts down, hooks the freshly slain carcass with its tendrils, and reels in its meal. The mindless ooze or other creature that just had its food stolen rarely holds a grudge and simply slithers off to find a new quarry, letting the drakauthix digest the corpse in peace. Of course, the drakauthix isn’t above feasting on more active prey as well, and might attack an adventurer who neglects to look upward for danger when exploring a network of mysterious caves.

While female driders have the upper torsos of elegant drow women with mouths featuring sharp poisoned fangs, male driders have hideous, mutated countenances that further blend the humanoid form with that of a spider; the difference in appearance is perhaps a reflection on the matriarchal nature of drow society. In combat, all driders are equally dangerous. Although the fleshwarping process was originally intended to be a punishment for drow who fell from grace, the significant powers and strengths gained from the horrifying transformation are attractive to some drow, and an increasing number of lower-ranking citizens in drow cities volunteer themselves for the painful procedure. In return for mandatory time (typically measured in decades) serving as a guardian, soldier, or other public servant, such volunteer driders are later allowed to lead their own lives, typically in caverns located in a city’s periphery. The painful truth is that for most driders, they do not live long enough to see this reward, for the drow have a penchant for working their fleshwarped slaves to death or deploying them in deadly war missions in which survival is a only a remote possibility. Most driders use arcane magic, but driders who use divine magic are well known, while a rare few use occult or primal magic.

Yet those who have the chance to watch elananxes hunt or attack prey witness the greatest indication that these creatures are something more than mere predators, for they act with cruel and savvy instincts, reveling in the pain they infiict. Elananxes typically hunt alone, but sometimes these cunning and malicious hunters of the First World roam in packs called “billows” to take down large prey. Like many house cats, elananxes are not content to merely track and devour prey, but prefer to toy with their victims, drawing joy and excitement from the fear and pain of those they capture. To this end, elananxes rarely use their cinder dispersal ability to evade their targets, instead opting to foil their quarry just before the end of the hunt—though, as selfish creatures who wish to live to hunt again, elananxes often reserve one use of this ability, just in case. Because of their clever and malicious ways, elananxes are favored as hunting companions by redcaps, who go out of their way to befriend or make deals with these creatures. Redcaps also flnd great sport in hunts where competing elananxes chase a single creature. Although they’re large enough to serve as mounts for redcaps, elananxes despise being ridden and resist such attempts—little is as sure to cause a supposedly friendly elananx to turn on its redcap ally than a foolhardy attempt to treat the fey cat as a horse! Elananxes have a strange affinity to forest fires. Because they are immune to the damage caused by flickering flames, they enjoy capering and caterwauling through the smoky, burning ruins of forest infernos. Some have even been known to use their burning bites to deliberately light undergrowth on fire, simply so they might experience the beauty of the flames combined with the inevitable pain such disasters inflict on other creatures.Recall Knowledge - Fey (Nature): DC 22Elananx","image_url":"Images\\Monsters\\Elananx.png","origin":""},{"name":"Elasmosaurus","family":"—","level":7,"alignment":"Neutral","creature_type":"Animal","size":"Huge","traits":["Animal"],"rarity":"Common","id":"Monsters.aspx?ID=645","lore":"ElasmosaurusElasmosauruses are long-necked, primeval reptiles that dwell in deep oceans and seas.

The emperor bird was given its current name 2,000 years ago when Taldor’s Sixth Army of Exploration ventured into the Mwangi Expanse. When the legion spotted this 6-foot-long bird with its spectacular multicolored feathers trailing from its tail, wings, and crest, the soldiers thought the bird regal enough to suit their emperor, disregarding the name the Mwangi had given to the bird generations before, bebaki. Keeping an emperor bird was, for many years, a sign of prestige among the nobility of Taldor. That was long ago, however, and emperor birds eventually fell out of fashion. Inevitably their former owners forgot about their colorful pets, and hundreds of neglected emperor birds were released back into the wild by weary servants. While many such freed birds perished quickly in the unfamiliar woodlands of Avistan, some managed to hold out, and emperor birds can still be encountered in the Verduran Forest. The emperor bird uses its brilliant, iridescent plumage for mating displays as well as for intimidating rival suitors and potential predators.

They resemble decaying humanoids, but with elongated arms, teeth, and bone-like spikes protruding from their upper backs. Festrogs' tendency to run on all fours has led to them gaining the moniker dog-ghouls, causing the unwary to mistake them for mindless predators. Festrogs are in fact intelligent, stalking victims in packs and choosing hunting grounds that suit their abilities. They can often be found roaming farmlands, open forests, or wide plains, anywhere they can use their quadrupedal speed to overtake quarry. Belying their mindless appearance, festrogs use tactics similar to those of hunters with hounds: the leader of the pack often flushes prey from cover so that the victim can be brought down by the pack. Researchers of the necromantic processes that creates risen corpses have found that festrogs spawn more often from slow demises than sudden deaths. Festrogs typically animate from corpses afflicted with disease, while victims of violence are more likely to become more common undead, such as zombies. One documented way to create a festrog is to have scavengers feed on the dead flesh before animating it. This potentially explains why festrogs most often arise in remote areas stricken with famine and desperate predators. Though most festrogs arise from humans and other prevalent humanoids, other creatures that die in the same circumstances can rise as festrogs. Festrogs that were once larger humanoids such as ogres, hill giants, or trolls behave similarly to other humanoid festrogs and are simply larger and more powerful. More peculiar are the beastkin festrogs formed of quadrupedal animals, which typically have feet or hooves instead of hands, travel on all fours at all times, and have only animal intelligence.

No longer human at all, these people, who call themselves kayals, have become monochromatic in coloration, with flesh tones and hair colors varying between white, black, and all shades of gray. Their limbs are lithe and willowy, and their eyes are generally solid yellow, yellow-green, or white, though a rare few have a purple or blue glow. Fetchlings have developed their own complex societies in the Shadow Plane, often under the tolerance of or in servitude to the strange, malignant creatures there, such as the sinister velstracs or the enigmatic d'ziriaks. While individual fetchlings can be any alignment, they are all survivors in a harsh environment, which leads to a tendency toward pragmatism. Fetchling clothing mimics the regions they dwell in, with drab colors tending toward darker shades. When they trade with humans or other societies on the Material Plane, they often wear masks or concealing clothing to hide their appearance. Typical fetchling communities are insular and swiftly close ranks in the event of an intruder. Though individual fetchlings don't mind traveling to and blending in with other societies to facilitate trade, they often hide or even react defensively if they have their own visitors. When one considers the nature of the other denizens of the Shadow Plane, however, this tendency to assume the worst of interlopers might make sense to some. Fetchlings are not as common on the Material Plane; most of those who dwell there are loners by choice who have left their home to seek out adventure elsewhere, exiles who were banished from their homelands, or planar castaways with no ability to return to the Shadow Plane. This last category, the lost and stranded, are the most likely to be found in larger groups. In cities of significant size, one can sometimes even find a small community of a few dozen or more fetchlings living among humans, although they often do so subtly by dyeing their hair, wearing brightly colored clothing, and utilizing layers of makeup to hide their pallid complexions.Recall Knowledge - Humanoid (Society): DC 15Fetchling Scout","image_url":"Images\\Monsters\\Fetchling_FetchlingScout.png","origin":""},{"name":"Filth Fire","family":"Elemental, Fire","level":4,"alignment":"Neutral Evil","creature_type":"Elemental","size":"Medium","traits":["Elemental","Fire"],"rarity":"Common","id":"Monsters.aspx?ID=656","lore":"Filth FireThese creatures look like roiling clouds of black smoke churning above a mound of burning refuse.

The story of their creation is lost to antiquity, though their propensity for attacking sea devils and alghollthus suggests they might have been engineered by some enemy of these creatures. Modern galvos aren't choosy about their prey, and because they can operate as well on land as they do in the water, they enjoy feasting on aquatic creatures and land dwellers alike. A galvo's body forms something roughly shaped like a human, but with eels continually moving throughout it and shifting the shape of its mass. The galvo can even disperse into a swarm of eels, though it usually does so only to travel through narrow spaces or otherwise accomplish things it's incapable of in its normal form. These component eels share some element of a collective consciousness, giving the galvo more intelligence than a typical animal. Individual galvos generally don't have any need for or interest in socializing, though they sometimes gather to collaborate while hunting. Electricity arcs throughout a galvo, and the more the eels that make it up move about, the larger and more impressive the electric display. This electricity creates a damaging field around the galvo that causes small fish and other sea life to drop dead. Many galvos contentedly snack on these prey. Even beyond the harmful field, underwater creatures feel a faint unease from galvos, and might notice how ferrous trinkets and sediment slowly drift toward them. A galvo attack could come from a lone creature or a small group. In addition to dangers of the electricity field generated by galvos' eels, galvos might attack by biting with their eels' maws or even firing off one of their eels like a dart, striking a distant target with a living, electrified projectile.\nRecall Knowledge - Aberration (Occultism): DC 26Galvo","image_url":"Images\\Monsters\\Galvo.png","origin":""},{"name":"Gancanagh (Passion Azata)","family":"Azata","level":4,"alignment":"Chaotic Good","creature_type":"Celestial","size":"Medium","traits":["Azata","Celestial"],"rarity":"Common","id":"Monsters.aspx?ID=35","lore":"Gancanagh (Passion Azata)Gancanaghs are lovers, revelers, and dashing duelists of Elysium.

A gargoyle’s features are not flxed; city-dwelling gargoyles who remain in the same locale long enough slowly morph, day by day, to match the style of the local architecture. These patient monsters can stay disguised for long stretches of time as they patiently await an opportunity to strike. Gargoyles tend to be lone hunters, though sometimes they band into fearsome tribes called “wings” for protection or sport. On rare occasions, wings become relatively stable communities, and gargoyles in wings may even ally with other creatures such as demons and intelligent aberrations, though these alliances exist on a razor’s edge. The majority of gargoyles are treacherous, vindictive, and petty—traits that preclude lasting partnerships. Many tend to be obsessive and compulsive. Some are collectors, focusing on anything from books to grim trophies, while others are ritualistic or overly passionate about niche intellectual subjects or certain artistic motifs. These tendencies often contribute to the dissolution of wings as individuals’ obsessions and compulsions clash.

Farmers and ranchers, especially those living near swamps known to contain giant slugs, keep close tabs on these journeys. Many almanacs go into great detail on slug migration and mating seasons. Since each giant slug needs its own wide hunting ground, the creatures typically come into proximity to mate only once a year. Either or both slugs can become impregnated, and any that do typically lay a clutch of around 100 eggs. They usually lay these eggs in a shallow bog or a cool, humid cave.

Though mindless, globsters are predators that seek out living quarry. They often huddle on the seafloor, where their own fetid mass attracts scavengers who swiftly become the ooze's next meal. When the tides wash these monsters ashore, they simply shift to hunting land-bound prey. Coastal communities usually notice the smell of a washed-up globster long before they see it. Those sent to investigate often mistake a globster for the carcass of a beached whale before getting too close and discovering the presumed corpse is very much alive and hungry. Sages once believed globsters were undead, undulating wads of rotting flesh driven to feed, but though mindless, they are very much alive. They are attracted to waterside refuse dumps and floating garbage scows and dimly aware enough to congregate where food is plentiful. Globsters consume living creatures but digest only a portion of them. The undigested dross accumulates within the globster as it becomes more and more bloated. They carry this fetid mass within their squelching bodies until instinct or injury provokes them to vomit forth a new globster to help devour everything nearby. A globster with enough dross to create a new globster automatically does so as a free action triggered upon taking damage.

Goblin dogs frequently lair and roam in packs, but they are likely to flee from a fight if injured, even if it means abandoning their pack-mates. Goblin dogs take their name from their long association with goblins, who breed the beasts as guard animals and mounts. Most goblins take issue with the name, as the average goblin is appalled at the suggestion that these, their favored mounts, have anything at all to do with actual dogs. Of course, being goblins, they haven’t bothered to come up with their own, unique name for goblin dogs. Even the most pampered goblin dogs have itchy mange and prolific dander that tenaciously affects those who come in contact with them. This “goblin pox” causes itchy hives and festering sores that are as unsightly as they are irritating and distracting. Goblin dog dander causes allergic reactions in nearly all other creatures that don’t share the goblin dogs’ terrible hygiene—with the notable exception, of course, of goblins, who remain entirely immune to the disease regardless of cleanliness. Hunger can drive goblin dogs to bouts of uncharacteristic violence; many goblins purposefully starve their pets to make them more aggressive in battle. Goblin dogs subsist on whatever organic material they can scavenge, and they particularly enjoy fresh carrion. Although goblins are far from picky eaters, they value goblin dogs as pets because the noisome animals will consume food that even goblins won’t dare to eat. “Will it eat?” is one of several games goblins enjoy playing with their goblin dog pets, where a wide range of mouth-sized morsels (not always edible or safe to consume) are dangled before a goblin dog’s snout. “Will it die?” is often a game played after “Will it eat?” Goblin dogs who survive the second game earn renown for their digestive prowess and often become favored tribal pets treated better than most of the rank-and-file goblins.Recall Knowledge - Animal (Nature): DC 15Goblin Dog","image_url":"Images\\Monsters\\GoblinDog.png","origin":""},{"name":"Goblin Pyro","family":"Goblin","level":1,"alignment":"Chaotic Evil","creature_type":"Humanoid","size":"Small","traits":["Goblin","Humanoid"],"rarity":"Common","id":"Monsters.aspx?ID=234","lore":"Goblin PyroSome goblins take their people’s admiration of fire fully into the realm of deadly obsession.

Gorgons are dangerous on their own, and when they band together in herds, they become especially deadly. Gorgons typically subsist on petrified flesh or fossils. These supernatural beasts can gain sustenance from natural stone if they must, though they find raw stone flavorless, so it's not a preferred food source.

Such vigils in fact lie within the providence of the psychopomps, a race of immortals charged with the protection and guidance of mortal souls through the afterlife. The Grim Reaper has little interest in protecting souls or guiding them. It is instead compelled by sinister agendas arising within the nighted realm of Abaddon, where the Horsemen of the Apocalypse rule. Indeed there are many similarities in shape and form between the Grim Reaper and Charon, the Horseman of Death, but no recorded instance exists of these two powerful entities working together. Instead, the Grim Reaper serves as something of a manifestation of Abaddon itself, and in this regard is believed by some to be an incarnation of the mysterious First Horseman. When the Grim Reaper comes to a world, it does so not as an angel of mercy, but as a relentless harvester of life. Those who fall to the Grim Reaper were not destined to die as much as they were selected, hunted, and murdered. Perhaps the most frightening legends surrounding the Grim Reaper concern its nature as a singular entity, for some believe that more than one grim reaper exists in the Great Beyond. These whispers tell of a cabal of at least nine of these creatures that stalk reality, culling the living as inexplicable servants of true entropy. According to the teaching of some death cults, the final goal of the Grim Reaper is to end the entire cycle of life and death and serve as a silent lord of an empty universe.Recall Knowledge - Undead (Religion): DC 52Grim Reaper","image_url":"Images\\Monsters\\GrimReaper.png","origin":""},{"name":"Grimple","family":"Gremlin","level":-1,"alignment":"Chaotic Evil","creature_type":"Fey","size":"Tiny","traits":["Fey","Gremlin"],"rarity":"Common","id":"Monsters.aspx?ID=1177","lore":"GrimpleEven more than most gremlins, grimples resent the trappings of civilization: inn common rooms with their rowdy singalongs, livery yards with their whinnying horses, church steeples with their clanging bells.

Though they prefer to hunt from the shadows, grimstalkers do not fear taking their grisly work to the very edges of civilization. This boldness serves as a reminder that nature can be cruel, capricious, and owes no debt to humanity. Grimstalkers are happy to perform nature's dirty work and particularly enjoy targeting loggers, hunters, and explorers, regardless of whether they respect the natural setting they work or travel within. Grimstalkers are gaunt and hairless, and their mottled, green and brown flesh gives them the appearance of moss-draped bark. When damaged, they bleed a thick, sap-like blood. They mark their territories by lopping off the heads of their victims and stringing them up in the surrounding trees, a practice that often lures dangerous scavengers into their lands. Carnivorous and thorny plants are often found in wilds where grimstalkers dwell, filling roles that pets might in human society, though grimstalkers tend to treat these “pets” poorly at best. There are few accounts of grimstalkers working with other fey—for the most part, grimstalkers see their kin from the First World as cowards or weaklings, or perhaps both. Even notoriously violent fey such as redcaps shy from them, as grimstalkers consider their own kind the only company worth keeping. Grimstalkers hunt in small bands, using stealth to approach their targets. They surround enemies first, then work to unnerve them by knocking on trees or howling out threats in Aklo to distract and panic their quarry. Of course, a band of grimstalkers won't stay together for long, quickly succumbing to bickering and infighting. These violent arguments are common pastimes among grimstalkers, often ending with each grimstalker going its own way. Not even the presence of more powerful fey or commanding creatures can keep grimstalkers from their predisposed bickering. Some scholars theorize that this quality speaks to an ancient curse that once afflicted fey who were judged too cantankerous, but in truth, it's just part of what makes a grimstalker what it is: ill-tempered, confrontational, and bitter.Recall Knowledge - Fey (Nature): DC 20Grimstalker","image_url":"Images\\Monsters\\Grimstalker.png","origin":""},{"name":"Grindylow","family":"—","level":0,"alignment":"Chaotic Evil","creature_type":"Aberration","size":"Small","traits":["Aberration","Amphibious"],"rarity":"Common","id":"Monsters.aspx?ID=692","lore":"GrindylowThe top half of a grindylow looks vaguely like that of a goblin, but from the waist down, their bodies split into a tangle of suckered, wriggling tentacles.

Grindylows generally organize into schools ranging from a few individuals to a few hundred. Smaller schools can sometimes be brought under the leadership of a powerful aquatic creature, though such alliances last only until the school faces a major setback, at which point the surviving grindylows scatter and form smaller schools of their own. Grindylows aren't territorial, but they are pragmatic; while they rarely build permanent structures, they will adopt a good hunting ground for generations until driven away by predators. They often lair in mobile shelters, such as a sargasso of seaweed or the hull of an abandoned ship. They are skilled scavengers and hunters that eat anything they can sink their teeth into. Grindylows respect the power of bigger sea predators but have a special hatred for squids (or anything they believe looks like a squid). Sailors plying grindylow-infested waters often paint the images of squids on the bottoms of their hulls in hopes of warding the little terrors off. While this can keep smaller schools at bay, it can also backfire, potentially inciting larger groups to gather for a coordinated attack; this becomes especially more likely if the ship's route becomes predictable.

Due to their modest understanding of agriculture, gripplis don't maintain typical farms like other humanoids do. Rather, they cultivate mushroom patches and gather a wide array of fruits from the surrounding wilderness. While most gripplis hunt insects, some societies also capture and breed them, nurturing herds of giant dragonflies or beetles that they eventually slaughter for food. Particularly enterprising gripplis might even seek out and tame larger flying insects to use as mounts during their hunts. The rearing of such massive insects is no easy feat, however, so gripplis who manage to do so are often heralded as local heroes. Gripplis usually construct their villages in particularly dense copses, stringing thin rope bridges between wide wooden platforms built around each trunk.

Herecites often outlast the cults that create them. Stranded herecites are drawn to others of their kind, even if they are dedicated to different evil deities, and when brought together they perform rites to magically bind themselves in a group known as a cabal.

Such a fellowship of sorrow is nigh unbreakable, as many an overzealous crusader has discovered far too late. Customarily found within heavily modified temples to the pantheon of gods they collectively worship, herecites act in service to their creators or as protectors of unholy ground. High priests of different evil gods may even trade herecites among themselves, allowing their minions to form cabals strengthened by their varied faiths. A lone herecite cut off from its creators—often because it is the sole remnant of a destroyed temple or its master has perished—may wander far and wide in search of a cabal to join. Other times, the herecite seeks out a place sacred to the deity it worshipped in life.

Regardless of their original source, these animals are now a common sight in the skies above their favored plains or hill country. Hippogriffs bear the wings, forelegs, and head of a bird of prey, with feather coloration similar to that of a hawk or eagle, though some breeders have managed to produce specimens with stark-white or coal-black feathers. Their torso, hindquarters, and tail resemble those of a horse and usually are colored bay, chestnut, or gray, with some coats bearing black, pinto, or even palomino coloration. Hippogriffs are similar in size to large horses. Much like their equine cousins, hippogriffs often have to keep wary eyes on the skies above them, as both are preferred meals for hungry griffons and wyverns. Only hippogriffs' superior speed helps protect them from these predators. Hippogriffs are exceptionally territorial and fiercely protect the lands under their domain. They typically favor sweeping grasslands, rolling hills, and prairies. Exceptionally hardy hippogriffs make their homes nestled into niches on canyon walls, from which they comb the rocky deserts for coyotes, deer, and the occasional humanoid. Hippogriffs prefer mammalian prey, but they graze after every meal to aid in digestion. Since hippogriff hunting habits can be dangerous to both ranchers and their livestock, such communities often set bounties on hippogriffs. As a result, preserved hippogriffs frequently decorate frontier taverns and remote outposts alongside the taxidermic remains of deer, elk, and bears. However, other communities train hippogriffs from hatching to be ridden by elite soldiers in combat— the most notable among these groups in the Inner Sea region is the Sable Company Mercenaries in the city-state of Korvosa. Attempts are sometimes made to train adult hippogriffs in the same manner, but this often proves far more difficult.

When a crafter first begins to study the art of creating constructs, she often crafts a homunculus first, since the creation process is simple and inexpensive due to a magical shortcut: the use of the creator’s own blood. This forges a link between the homunculus and its master, causing the homunculus to gain a spark of the creator’s intellect, as well as the same moral values and some of the creator’s basic personality traits. Homunculi left to their own devices never stray far from their masters. In most cases, a homunculus doesn’t survive the death of its master for long. Deprived of its creator, a homunculus loses focus and grows increasingly self-destructive, and some even end up battering themselves to destruction. Rarely, a homunculus with a slain master survives the trauma with its mind intact, often seeing itself as its deceased creator’s child or successor and attempting to further its creator’s legacy as best it can. In such cases, and if the homunculus was in close proximity to its master upon that creature’s death, a portion of the dead master’s soul “infects” the surviving homunculus as it passes on to the afterlife. This doesn’t result in a truly soulbound homunculus (see sidebar), since only a fragment of the soul is left behind, but this is still enough to grant the homunculus a greater personality, free will of its own, and perhaps most importantly, the ability to speak. Over time, a few of these “awakened” homunculi even go so far as to become convinced that they are the reincarnation of their prior masters, although their actual personalities never quite reach the depth and complexity of a truly living creature. They are, at best, caricatures of the master, and at worst they become awful, bitter-minded parodies of life itself. Still, a free-willed homunculus might pursue studies in its creator’s class, becoming a unique creature with the abilities of that class if time and fortune permit. Homunculi are created from a mixture of clay, ash, mandrake root, spring water, and a pint of the creator’s own blood.

When students of the magic school called the Acadamae failed in their studies and allowed their imp familiars to run wild, these tiny dragons found that they were particularly well suited to combating them. Most notably, their teeth become striated with silver due to their peculiar grooming habits, allowing their bites to puncture the imps' magically resistant skin. The two species are well-matched in intellect. Though their clashes typically begin with trying to outwit one another, they often end in messy brawls across rooftops and into alleys. The residents of Korvosa appreciated both the protection and the dragons' charming appearance and demeanor. House drakes are now more common in Korvosa than anywhere else in the world. House drakes are carnivorous, eating vermin and small birds. Though they're capable of hunting for food, many of them find it a bit dull and prefer to spend their time at other pursuits. They happily accept donations of food. To truly get on a house drake's good side, though, one should offer a gift of silver. Donations to drakes have become regular practice in Korvosa, to the point where “Paid any drakes lately?” has become a common phrase to suggest someone is a bit gullible and soft-hearted. These donations are just that—charity. House drakes avoid taking on anything resembling a “job,” taking pride in their self-sufficiency and ability to choose for themselves how to spend their time.Recall Knowledge - Dragon (Arcana): DC 15House Drake","image_url":"Images\\Monsters\\HouseDrake.png","origin":""},{"name":"Huldra","family":"—","level":4,"alignment":"Chaotic Neutral","creature_type":"Fey","size":"Medium","traits":["Fey"],"rarity":"Uncommon","id":"Monsters.aspx?ID=1197","lore":"HuldraAt first glance, a huldra seems a simple creature—a human in plain robes or peasant dress, sporting long, unbound hair. These tresses and full skirts in fact disguise the huldra's supernatural features: a hollow wooden back, a long bovine tail, and incredible strength. Folk legends from the lands of the north describe huldras as the creations of troll witches, intended to lure potential meals to the slaughter. Indeed, a huldra's regeneration is so similar to a troll's that a link between the two creatures seems entirely possible, but huldras despise trolls and resent tales suggesting any connection between them. Rather, huldras are wardens of the woodlands they occupy. Grown from saplings by powerful forest-dwelling fey as a response to humanoid encroachment, huldras protect and parley for the forest itself. Woodland creatures adore huldras, and sometimes approach humans or elves thinking they're huldras. This illusion is shattered if the animal sees the humanoid's back is made of flesh or that they're lacking a tail, at which point the animal recoils and runs away. Huldras respond well to travelers who show respect and deference for the forest, bestowing those they favor with supernatural luck and fortune. Those who scorn or attack a huldra, or those who mock their distinctive, bovine tails, find themselves plagued by poor decisions and even worse luck. Huldras commonly carry a bad reputation as sirens of the deep forest—cunning monsters who seek to lure woodcutters and unwary adventurers to uncertain ends. These stories largely come from miscreants foolish enough to have treated a huldra rudely and later complain about how they were unjustly persecuted. Even woodcutters and hunters can stay in the good graces of huldras provided they plant new trees to replace what they've taken and don't kill any creatures they don't eat. Though huldras choose to appear unassuming, the attention they put into disguising the supernatural parts of their bodies is sometimes lacking when it comes to their strength. They often perform feats of strength, like bending horseshoes straight or lifting heavy objects, without realizing they're breaking their carefully crafted facade.Recall Knowledge - Fey (Nature): DC 21Huldra","image_url":"Images\\Monsters\\Huldra.png","origin":""},{"name":"Hunting Spider","family":"Spider","level":1,"alignment":"Neutral","creature_type":"Animal","size":"Medium","traits":["Animal"],"rarity":"Common","id":"Monsters.aspx?ID=386","lore":"Hunting SpiderHunting spiders are the most common type of giant spider, though not the largest.Recall Knowledge - Animal (Nature): DC 15Hunting Spider","image_url":"","origin":""},{"name":"Hyaenodon","family":"Hyena","level":3,"alignment":"Neutral","creature_type":"Animal","size":"Large","traits":["Animal"],"rarity":"Common","id":"Monsters.aspx?ID=271","lore":"HyaenodonHyaenodons are the ferocious primeval cousins of the smaller hyena.

The jabberwock hails from the fey realm of the First World and is part of a group of powerful First World creatures known collectively as the Tane.Like all members of the Tane, jabberwocks are living creatures that age, eat, drink, and sleep, but do not reproduce normally. Instead, they are created directly by the godlike Eldest who rule the First World, and they serve at the pleasure (or frustration) of these capricious and mysterious entities. Believed to be the most powerful of all the Tane, jabberwocks are typically only ever created with one purpose: to wreak destruction and havoc upon the Material Plane. One of the Eldest might send a jabberwock to devastate a country, continent, or even entire world in order to get revenge for some slight made against them by a single mortal. Sometimes, no specific insult or injury is required, as some of the Eldest resent the very existence of the Material Plane and periodically create jabberwocks simply to express the wrath of the First World against its younger and less chaotic sibling.Once a jabberwock arrives on the Material Plane, its first order of business is to seek out a lair. It prefers dwelling in remote forest locations about a day's flight from civilization—the more dangerous the woodland is to those who might eventually come hunting it, the better! The relationship between jabberwocks and vorpal weapons is the subject of much debate and speculation among scholars, and the various poems, songs, and legends about the jabberwock do little to clarify the issue, conflicting and diverging on this point. Some believe that vorpal weapons were first created specifically to combat jabberwocks, but others take the story one step further. They cite evidence in certain ancient myths that there may once have been only a single, unique jabberwock, so powerful that nothing could so much as scratch it—nothing, that is, except for the first vorpal sword, crafted for that very purpose. So epic was the resulting battle that it created strange echoes throughout reality, and as a result, these echoes, in the form of vorpal weapons, can now be found on many worlds. Those who subscribe to this belief claim that the jabberwocks seen today are but pale imitations of this proto-jabberwock, and they speculate that only the combined efforts of several Eldest would be sufficient to create such a creature again.Variant JabberwocksThe Eldest have sometimes altered certain aspects of the jabberwocks they create. Some of the more notorious or legendary variant jabberwocks include the following.Frumious Jabberwock: Frumious jabberwocks have two heads. They are level 24 and gain an extra action on each of their turns they can use only to make a jaws Strike.Mimsy Jabberwock: Typically hailing from wintry regions of the First World, mimsy jabberwocks have glowing blue-white scales, resist cold instead of fire, and have eyes that burn with blue flames that deal cold damage instead of fire damage.Slithy Jabberwock: Wreaking destruction beneath the waves, these sinuous and slimy jabberwocks are amphibious, have a swim Speed of 80 feet instead of the normal fly Speed, and do not have a wing Strike.

These generally placid herbivores are shy of other creatures, preferring to live in open grasslands where their keen ears and eyes can spot danger approaching from a distance. Male kangaroos develop powerful front limbs and exhibit a dominance behavior commonly known as “boxing.” When two male kangaroos confront each other, they draw close; they then swat at their opponent with their front claws while also pulling their own heads back out of range. Kangaroos also occasionally rock back on their tails before delivering a blow with their heavily muscled hind legs. The claws on their back legs make these blows particularly deadly, and a kangaroo can disembowel an attacker with a single strike using this tactic. Like other marsupials, female kangaroos carry their young—called joeys—in a pouch on their bellies. They have only one such offspring at a time, although many females have several joeys in quick succession. These social animals largely gather for protection, but their social structures are similar to those found in herds of camels, horses, or pigs. Kangaroos don't make particularly good mounts, but this hasn't stopped the occasional adventurous gnome or halfling from trying. Such an attempt usually results in a seasick and dizzy rider being dumped unceremoniously from the animal's back or pouch, but some druids have found them to be loyal companions. In places where kangaroos are common, the animals are sometimes hunted for meat and can even provide a primary food supply to migratory communities due to their quick reproduction and ability to flee predators. People in other regions consider kangaroos a delicacy and often import their meat as a show of status in wealthy households. Several types of kangaroos have evolved, each living in a slightly different environment. Gray kangaroos are smaller than other varieties and dwell in open woodlands, most commonly on the southern reaches of the continent of Garund. Giant kangaroos, found primarily on the dry steppes of northern Casmaron, grow to twice the size of standard kangaroos, and the thunderous noise of their passing can be heard and felt from miles away. The kangaroo family also has several smaller relatives, including wallabies and pademelons.

His long, greasy tongue continually flickers out from his mouth, occasionally licking droplets of spittle from his dark brown fur. He wields a set of iron chains that act as an extension of his will. Krampus is never seen without a wicker basket draped over one shoulder, its bottom often stained with the blood of his victims. Krampus stands a little over 14 feet tall and weighs nearly 1,000 pounds. Krampus's origin is unknown; residents of the small towns and villages he terrorizes in northern Irrisen believe the creature has always existed, coming forth once a year to punish those he deems wicked. While many legends have been told about Krampus's beginning, the most popular of them starts with a handful of mountain towns under the protection of a circle of druids. After a series of harsh winters that the townsfolk barely survived, they began to doubt the power of the druids and their rituals. As the villagers grew more resentful, the druid circle took drastic action. Under the light of a blue moon, the druids opened an imperfect portal to the primal realm of the fey and called forth the most powerful spiritual essence they could, and a new creature was born—Krampus. However, unknown to the druids, the portal had been corrupted by the villagers' bitter resentment and doubt. Instead of a central figure to lead them in winter celebrations, as they had hoped, the druids had spawned a monster who sought to punish those who had behaved selfishly during lean times. Recognizing their error, the druids sought to banish their creation. They tracked Krampus down as he slept and shackled him in cold iron chains, hoping to subdue him and force him back to the First World. But Krampus was no fey, and cold iron held no power over him. When he awoke, he ripped the chains free, claimed them as his own, and tracked down the druids who had dared try to capture him. After their betrayal, Krampus can see no good in any mortal and longs only to punish the wicked for their selfish misdeeds. To this day, Krampus takes vicious delight in transforming his victims into the petulant children before killing them, and no manner of sacrifice can appease him. Luckily for any nearby villages, Krampus stalks their streets but once a year. Locals believe that Krampus makes his lair among the deep crevasses of ice somewhere within the Winterwall Glacier, which lines Avistan's northernmost reaches.

While they are known to hunt and eat crocodiles, alligators, and virtually any creature with flesh, their favorite prey are lizardfolk, boggards, and dinosaurs. Krooths are found alone or in packs. Male krooths are solitary and territorial creatures—fierce, bold, and bloodthirsty. Female krooths, on the other hand, are likely to shy away from potential predators but swiftly turn violent when their brood is threatened. Because their offspring are so vulnerable, female krooths gather in packs to raise their young, sending smaller groups to hunt for food while the rest of the pack watches the brood. Krooths mate only once every 4 or 5 years, and the mating process is a curiously gruesome spectacle. An entire pack of females will hunt as a group for a lone male krooth, claiming their prize in an orgiastic frenzy that can last for an entire day and night. After the mating has finished, the females slay their mate and devour his nutrient-rich flesh, and his organs in particular. These organs contain a unique chemical compound vital to gestation. Many naturalists will pay handsomely for the fresh remains of a male krooth so they can study the strange properties of the creature’s blood and organs. In addition, krooths have poisonous, hollow teeth. When these creatures bite their prey, a tooth breaks off and causes the victim to bleed profusely as their blood pours through the hollow tooth. Whether male or female, krooths seem to be repelled by goblinoid flesh, especially that of bugbears.

The most dangerous mohrgs are those who grow powerful enough to no longer fear being struck down again and openly assault settlements in an attempt to turn living towns into mass graves. Since those slain by a mohrg rise soon thereafter as mohrg spawn, the murders of a mohrg rarely go unnoticed for long, even when they take extra care to prey only on a society's dregs. Since mohrg spawn remain under a mohrg's control, a canny mohrg might order its spawn to remain in hiding to keep its presence secret until a point where it feels confident unleashing its undead army upon a doomed settlement. Mohrgs retain a twisted sentimentality for the crimes of their mortal life, seeking out trinkets that remind them of favorite murders. When not out hunting, mohrgs arrange their mementos into disturbing shrines. Often, these trinkets are valuable objects, and might even provide important clues to ongoing mysteries.Mohrg Spawn When a creature returns after death as a mohrg spawn, its flesh decays away save for its entrails, and it grows a long, awful tongue. The creature gains the undead trait and becomes chaotic evil, and it loses any abilities that come from it being a living creature. It gains darkvision, negative healing, and the mohrg's immunities and resistances. If the creature had hands, it gains a claw Strike (an unarmed attack that deals slashing damage). The creature also gains a tongue Strike, an agile attack that causes paralysis, as the mohrg ability; the Fortitude save uses the DC for the mohrg spawn's level.

They're majestic, territorial, and extremely grumpy—traits that make them dangerous to unwary travelers and would-be predators alike. Males are instantly recognizable, standing 7 feet tall at the shoulder, with large heads and thick necks to support their impressive palmate antlers. They shed their antlers come winter and grow a new set each year at a rapid rate. For most of the year, moose roam tundra, forest, and wilderness territories by themselves. Their hooves are wide, allowing them to more easily traverse the frequent snowfall of their native terrain, and they typically journey alone. Moose come together only during mating season, a time in which they become oddly social with one another, loud, and even more aggressive to other creatures than usual. A moose's diet consists of leaves, woody plant matter like twigs or bark, and buds of trees and shrubs. Moose are so large they prefer to eat the leaves of trees taller than humans instead of lowering their giant heads all the way to the ground. This can make them easy to track, though hunters will find actually killing a moose is a far greater challenge than finding it. Despite their size, moose have many natural predators, especially pack animals like wolves and large carnivores like tigers. Large humanoids like ogres and trolls dwelling in the wilderness sometimes make sport of chasing down and wrestling moose. Despite their large size, moose are expert swimmers in both fresh and salt water, and they readily feed on aquatic vegetation. Moose rarely swim into open seas, however, and usually stay close to land, though ocean predators have been known to hunt swimming moose.

Stories of minor miracles granted by nixies to those they befriend encourage humanoids to seek out these reclusive fey, and ironically make it even more unlikely for a nixie to grant such a boon. On the other hand, if someone approaches a nixie with respect, or even better, a positive attitude that displays just the right amount of humility and easygoing openness, a nixie is far more likely to respond positively to any requests for aid. Often a nixie will ask those who seek their assistance to perform a task for them first; such requests can be minor acts of entertainment (such as telling a rousing story or performing a requested song), but in other cases the nixie might need more significant aid, such as driving off an unwanted local predator or investigating the source of pollution near their home. Nixies resort to violence only if no other tactic works. They much prefer solutions that rely upon primal magic to defuse conflicts before they can escalate to bloodshed. In pursuit of such resolutions, nixies rely on their ability to charm individuals and, when they can establish magical influence, encourage intruders to leave peacefully. While some nixies try to confuse intruders and subtly guide them from the area, others use local animals and beasts to scare off trespassers. Occasionally, nixies recruit charmed humanoids to act as protectors or help with a task that is simply too big for them to deal with.

Many among norns serve Magdh the Three, the triune Eldest who some norns believe to be the first norn triumvirate bound together into one entity, as Magdh has three bodies: a Maiden, a Mother, and a Matriarch. Magdh claims to be watching the threads of fate for some ominous prophesied cataclysm, and in addition to assisting in her divinations, Magdh expects the norns who serve her to follow her cryptic commands to help nudge the future away from the brink. However, norns are powerful beings in their own right, themselves capable of granting divine power, and many balk at serving the enigmatic demigod. These norns find the other Eldest even more alien and challenging to interact with, for they believe that while the Eldest wield great power, even these powerful beings should not be granted leave to meddle with fate as much as they desire. While even the weakest of the Eldest could destroy an unaffiliated norn with ease, they tend to obey the proclamations and judgments of norns when they are spoken.

Unfortunately for those who desire a saddle-trained pegasus, pegasi are wild creatures and do not readily accept even well-intentioned riders. Pegasi actively resist being mounted or controlled by evil creatures, attempting to buck an unwanted rider at every opportunity. A typical pegasus stands 6 feet high at the shoulder, weighs 1,500 pounds, and has a wingspan of 20 feet. Pegasi are highly intelligent beasts and have a strong sense of pride and honor. The best way to entreat a pegasus is by speaking to it with grace and offering gifts appropriate to a creature of such majesty. Prospective riders who seek the mount for a worthy cause or virtuous quest have a much easier time coaxing a pegasus into granting its favor. Regardless, a pegasus never accepts a bit or saddle, for reasons both practical (a standard horse saddle interferes with its wings) and purely egotistical. In the wild, pegasi live in small herds and establish territories on remote mountains where they are relatively safe from hunters and slavers. They mature at the same rate as horses and can even breed with other equines, though the outcome of such unions is typically a foal with the traits of its least magical parent. On rare occasions, the interbreeding of a pegasus and a unicorn may result in a winged unicorn with characteristics of both parents and an unrivaled sense of righteousness. Some pegasi carry in them the blood of a mighty and heroic ancestor. These champions of pegasus-kind dedicate their long lives to the pursuit of justice.

Reefclaws are usually solitary hunters, but small swarms of female reefclaws have been known to gather around a single male for mating purposes or together for the communal raising of their broods. In the latter case, the females will perform widespread hunts in order to bring back a large enough bounty to feed their young. Such hunting parties are extremely dangerous—they’ve been known to tip over small flshing boats and attack those who fall overboard. Once a reefclaw has decided upon a course of action, it follows through even if doing so spells its own end. More than one reefclaw survivor has said that the creature released its bone-crushing grasp only after its brains were leaking from its broken skull, and even then the reefclaw was able to perform a terrible last slash as part of its dying breath. During mating season, female reefclaws are often a little more pragmatic and release their prey before endangering themselves and their offspring. Despite their intelligence and the accompanying moral quandaries, reefclaws frequently find their way onto the dinner plates of land-dwelling hunters such as humans and hobgoblins.

A roiling incant's appearance depends on the type of magic it sprang forth from, though it always carries with it an echo of the destruction it has caused. A fiery evocation roiling incant might look like a storm of burning ashes echoing with the sounds of crackling timber, while a necromancy roiling incant could be mistaken for ghostly tendrils puppeteering shambling corpses.

Each scarecrow is handcrafted and unique in its appearance, though most are 5 to 6 feet tall and constructed of a combination of wood, cloth, rope, straw, sawdust, discarded husks and cobs, and similar materials, all dressed in ragged pastoral garments.

When a scarecrow is created, it must be anointed with a drop of its creator's blood into each of its eyes. This blood soaks into the material and siphons a tiny sliver of the creator's soul away—not enough to harm the creator, but more than enough to imbue the scarecrow with an instinctive intellect that allows it to follow commands as eagerly as a well-trained (if ill-tempered) guard dog.

They don't take to combat naturally, though, and in dangerous situations, they're more likely to try and grab their rider with their strong, prehensile tails before swimming to safety, rather than staying in a fight. Like smaller seahorses, giant seahorses have bony armor plates on the outside of their bodies, covered by skin, which makes them fairly durable despite their reluctance to battle. Though not the strongest swimmers, seahorses rely primarily on natural camouflage to survive. Chromatophores in seahorses' skin allow them to camouflage themselves. This ability is fairly rudimentary, and the size of a giant seahorse makes this tactic far less effective for them than for their smaller kin. Their colors change slowly at most times, though when in a dangerous situation, the process occurs much more rapidly for the seahorse. Unlike regular seahorses, giant seahorses also rely on herd tactics for defense as well as their surprising physical strength. A herd of charging seahorses is just as terrifying and dangerous underwater as a herd of stampeding horses on land. Humanoids in underwater cultures learn at a young age to quickly get out of the way of a herd of stampeding seahorses. Baby giant seahorses are too big to easily float and lack sufficient strength to swim on their own for several weeks after birth. They instead link tails with an adult and allow themselves to be ferried around. An adult seahorse can carry upwards of 20 seahorse babies hanging from them at once, though these babies might occasionally get left behind or swept away by a strong current.

Their ability to fly through space affords them swift travel between Leng and more hospitable reaches of the Dreamlands, making them particularly sought after as mounts for those who have business in the far reaches of the dreaming plane. Convincing a shantak to become a mount is notoriously difficult. They refuse any sort of training, and even if one is convinced to ferry a humanoid on their back, they can be obstinate and fickle. Anyone relying on a shantak mount should have a backup plan ready in case the shantak strands their passenger on an asteroid or strange planet after some disagreement. Although a shantak is nearly the size of an elephant, many possess irrational fears of certain creatures. In particular, nightgaunts terrify them, but other shantaks have been observed fleeing from harpies and gargoyles. Though these ancestries all share the same trait, shantaks don't fear every type of winged humanoid, which makes the origin of their phobia all the more mysterious.

The most talented skinstitchers rarely bother with the humanoid form at all and instead opt to craft skinstitches that resemble other creatures sacred to Norgorber, such as scorpions, centipedes, or spiders. Rumors lurk of skinstitchers who can use exotic materials like steel, daemon flesh, or even magical shadows for their creations. The rotting materials used to build skinstitches tend to attract vermin, which can in turn form a hive or nest within the creations' bodies. Skinstitchers consider the presence of such tenants to be a sure sign of Norgorber's approval.Recall Knowledge - Construct (Arcana, Crafting): DC 22Skinstitch","image_url":"Images\\Monsters\\Skinstitch.png","origin":""},{"name":"Skrik Nettle","family":"—","level":6,"alignment":"Neutral","creature_type":"Aberration","size":"Large","traits":["Aberration"],"rarity":"Common","id":"Monsters.aspx?ID=804","lore":"Skrik NettleThe expansive skies of the First World are home to skrik nettles—delicate, bizarre-looking creatures that resemble large jellyfishes.

Known for their eerie, chirping melodies, skrik nettles soar above the First World in flocks of a dozen or more, diligently scavenging for food in the fey realm's cutthroat ecosystem. When hunting or provoked, skrik nettles attack their foes by injecting them with a magical poison that causes the victim to float helplessly up into the sky. Skrik nettles continuously inject this poison into their helpless prey until it dies or is so high up that the skrik nettle needs only wait for the poison to end, its meal crashing helplessly to the ground below. Skrik nettles that find their way to the Material Plane (or any plane other than the First World, for that matter) tend to be much more aggressive, for the planar energies that they find comforting and soothing on the First World are conspicuously absent. The first few minutes after a skrik nettle arrives on any plane but the First World tend to be filled with violence and fear, as the panicking creature lashes out at any nearby creatures (including other skrik nettles) in the mistaken notion that these others are somehow responsible for the discomforting change. After 10 minutes or so, assuming the skrik nettle survives its bout of violence, the creature calms down somewhat and does its best to acclimate to its new home.

Even murder is merely another necessity, and they think nothing of creeping into a house, dispatching the residents, and taking what they want. Their chameleon-like ability to blend into their surroundings makes skulks difficult to detect, so their ever-present populations around the periphery of large settlements are nearly impossible to dislodge permanently. They typically travel in small groups of no more than 16 individuals, since groups larger than that tend to break into violence directed at one other. While skulks see themselves as sharing a common history of being cast out and hated, this is not a strong enough bond to hold large groups of the creatures together with a shared purpose for very long. Entrances and exits from cities, especially less-guarded access ways around sewers and the like, are skulks' favorite stomping grounds. These sites allow them to closely observe who comes and goes from the city while also affording them swift escape options, should the authorities uncover their presence. On rare occasions, a well-disciplined skulk can rise to prominence within the local thieves' guild and become sought after for difficult jobs. Their repugnant personalities and overwhelming selfishness, however, usually means they are unable to secure long-lasting leadership roles. A typical skulk is 6 feet tall with similar body structure to a gangly human. Skulks mature quickly and can live up to 50 years, although most meet a violent end long before then. The rare skulk who manages to escape their society of violence and craven bitterness can be of any alignment, but those skulks who remain bound by their traditions always see these self-imposed exiles as the worst kind of traitors, and the exiles are often targeted for eradication to the exclusion of all other victims.

Their soft, dappled brown fur helps them hide in forest canopies, and they have shimmering insectile wings and big eyes that draw in the faintest beams of light. At first glance, a skull peeler looks like a cuddly pet or a wizard's familiar. Any illusions of domesticating such a beast are quickly dismissed upon seeing how a skull peeler eats, however. Skull peelers have evolved to hang motionlessly in treetop canopies as they wait until appropriate prey appears, usually long-necked dinosaurs but also brachiating primates and large birds. The skull peeler then lashes out with its long tongue, severing the creature's head from its body and pulling the detached cranium back into its hungry paws. It then uses its claws to crack open the cranial cavity—hence its name—before lapping up the tasty insides. Despite skull peelers' gruesome eating habits, some enterprises and individuals can't resist the urge to add these beasts to their menageries. Fey and other creatures with ties to the First World, such as gnomes, can occasionally coax a skull peeler into a form of domestication. While the adorable beasts can never be fully tamed due to their hyper-evolved hunting instincts, they can be bribed with food and, if kept satiated, displayed on a perch or indoor terrarium as an example of their master's cunning and deadliness. As often as not, these pseudo-domesticated skull peelers end up devouring a guest, pet, or their would-be owner, but this possibility doesn't stop up-and-coming crime lords from attempting to domesticate the little predators.

Slurks exude two very different types of foul-smelling secretions from their pale white skin. Large pustules on the slurk’s back drip a sticky resin-like slime that quickly hardens upon exposure to air. By flexing its skin, the slurk can burst these pustules in the direction of intruders, covering its foes in sticky goo and severely limiting their ability to withstand the monster’s other attacks, including the effects of its other secretion. Glands along the slurk’s ventral side excrete an incredibly slippery and fetid grease, which protects the slurk from the immobilizing effects of its own back slime but also has the added benefit of making it extremely difficult to grapple and capture. The best way to discover if a slurk is in the vicinity is to look for hard clumps of such grease, which accumulate and dry in cave corners and amid rock piles where the slurk rests between meals. Slurks are thought to be descendants of a failed dwarven attempt to domesticate and breed large subterranean frogs as food and labor animals.

Nevertheless, the arrival of a group of taiga giants is a potentially devastating event to any town or village, so many communities attempt to placate the giants by creating a yearly offering at those times when they know the giants are scheduled to come close. Most taiga giants venerate their ancestors and seek to honor their works in everything they do.

Regardless of their animating method, tattoo guardians can temporarily remove themselves from their ward's skin and attack or even interpose themselves between their ward and any dangers. Most tattoo guardians remain on their ward and attack without separating. Tattoo guardians come in a variety of forms, taking the shape of religious symbols, powerful creatures, or more abstract shapes. Magic reinforces the bond between a tattoo guardian and its ward, and the death of the ward also brings about the tattoo guardian's destruction. A guardian that is destroyed while its ward lives reverts to a mundane tattoo—often scarred or otherwise marred. Familial or cultural traditions contribute to the meaning of a tattoo guardian's appearance. In many dwarven cultures, a given family or clan develops their own tattoo patterns and uses these in any tattoo guardians they make.

Tatzlwyrms don't work with kobolds, though—tatzlwyrms eat kobolds. Tatzlwyrms hibernate in cold weather, and when they feel winter approaching they seek out underground lairs, mountain crevices, or even hay lofts. On one notable occasion, townsfolk reported being briefly overrun by tatzlwyrms after a conflict between spellcasters in the nearby hills caused a sudden blizzard. Local scholars still debate whether the cause of the influx was the sudden change in weather or if the creatures were drawn to one of the other magic users staying in town who were part of the same pilgrimage as those doing battle. When confronted, tatzlwyrms are more likely to attack than retreat. Indeed, they sometimes lie in wait on purpose, taking advantage of their scales' natural camouflage and awaiting the chance to unleash their signature move: belching poisonous vapor into an opponent's face.

Although humanoid, tengus have very distinct, birdlike features, and many would say that they resemble crows more than they do humans. They have strong, thick beaks, as well as sharp talons at the ends of their arms and legs. Most of a tengu’s body is covered in small feathers that range in color from dark brown and midnight blue to glossy black, with lighter colors being rare but not unheard of. Like many avian creatures, tengus have hollow bones, making them much lighter than other humanoids of their size, although few tengus possess the wings necessary to fly naturally. A tengu’s speech might be punctuated by quick clucks or throaty cawing, and many tengus practice conversation diligently to rid themselves of these involuntary ticks. Ruf  ing of the feathers and compulsive, jerky movements of the neck are other trademark habits. Tengus reproduce by laying eggs: the average tengu egg is about 11 inches in diameter and 16 inches tall and takes 4 months to hatch. Tengus are a people in diaspora and are almost always found within larger kingdoms and communities of other races. Perhaps because they are more visually distinctive than most other humanoid races, tengus tend to be distrusted and persecuted more often than, for example, elves or dwarves. As a result, tengus tend to gather in close-knit social groups composed of other outcasts and people of uncommon ancestry. Few true tengu communities exist, and those that do are often exiled to ghettos and other forgotten city quarters.

These strange creatures have oblong bodies coated in a viscous and transparent slime, three large black eyes, and eight thick, multi-jointed limbs, four of which are inverted and point upward, allowing the monster to easily crawl on either the ceiling or floor of narrow caverns and squeeze through narrow spaces. Their jaws appear small and tubular when closed but peel apart and stretch to terrifying proportions when opened, as their dozens of pointed teeth part to reveal a freakishly long tongue. A tixitog usually hides from the spiders in the lair it has claimed, not out of fear but to keep the spiders from abandoning the lair and moving elsewhere. When a tixitog emerges from the shadows, most spiders flee from it rather than attack, and the tixitog uses this behavior to direct entire swarms of spiders where it pleases. This is typically bad news for bands of adventurers who find themselves within a tixitog’s lair; in the mass hysteria caused by a skittering swarm of spiders headed straight toward them, spelunkers typically fail to notice the more dangerous threat that follows closely behind.Recall Knowledge - Aberration (Occultism): DC 20Tixitog","image_url":"Images\\Monsters\\Tixitog.png","origin":""},{"name":"Tolokand","family":"—","level":15,"alignment":"Neutral Evil","creature_type":"Aberration","size":"Large","traits":["Aberration"],"rarity":"Rare","id":"Monsters.aspx?ID=1343","lore":"TolokandStreams run dry.

Less seasoned travelers who encounter twigjacks in their canopied homes often mistake them for leshys, a tendency that frustrates twigjacks, as they have a low opinion of such creatures. More broadly, twigjacks resent being considered mere animated plants at all. Rather, they embrace their fey heritage—often to a foolish end. Twigjacks go out of their way to ingratiate themselves to the fey creatures they live among.

Many fey seem embarrassed by these strange cousins, but some spriggans, quicklings, and redcaps harness the twigjacks' violent urges and disruptive behavior for their own purposes.

These stories are encountered more often than their subject, however. A reclusive people, umasi live deep in remote jungles, largely isolated from other societies. Despite not being undead, umasi can't heal naturally or via magic. Instead, they must harvest appendages and organs from the living to perpetuate their own lives. These modifications require special techniques, obscure rituals, and often the assistance of other umasi. Shorter rituals make quick repairs to wounded flesh— even consuming a nutrient-rich organ of a recently slain creature can provide quick rejuvenation—while more extensive changes require a full day's work. Because of the nature of their existences, no one single form remains common to umasi. Many graft any number of arms or legs of various sizes on their bodies, while others are conglomerations of exotic beasts, other humanoids, and whatever creatures they've hunted or scavenged. However, all umasi remain vaguely humanoid in shape. An umasi with additional arms can hold or wield more items at once, while additional legs or other limbs might grant increased Speed or new types of Speed. Concepts such as gender, ethnicity, and even recognizing someone based on their appearance are irrelevant to umasi. Instead, they value age and experience and identify themselves with iconic adornments or speech patterns. Despite their morbid nature, umasi are rarely at odds with living creatures. These opportunistic hunters value their self-preservation, but use fast-acting nonlethal poisons to subdue their targets for safe and minimally destructive harvesting. Few umasi harbor malice toward the living, but some possess a streak of self-loathing and search for powerful magics that might break whatever curse binds them to their current state. Rarely, an umasi finds some strange form of acceptance on the fringes of a remote community where their skills at medicine carry more weight than fear of their strange appearances.Recall Knowledge - Aberration (Occultism): DC 24Recall Knowledge - Humanoid (Society): DC 24Umasi","image_url":"Images\\Monsters\\Umasi.png","origin":""},{"name":"Umonlee","family":"—","level":15,"alignment":"Neutral","creature_type":"Beast","size":"Huge","traits":["Amphibious","Beast","Cold"],"rarity":"Uncommon","id":"Monsters.aspx?ID=839","lore":"UmonleeThose who dwell in the coldest climates of Golarion tell of a brutal beast that swims through the ice and snow and can devastate entire villages in minutes. Ancient Erutaki who made their homes in the frozen polar expanse called the Crown of the World named this monster the umonlee. Umonlees are bestial predators who constantly hunt, rarely resting in service of a hunger that is never fully sated. Despite this animalistic drive, umonlees are semi-intelligent creatures who often select and stalk their prey. However, they are not terribly bright and often keep their hunting grounds in sparsely-trafficked areas. It is rare for an umonlee to attack a village, but one might attack a sparse group, such as a hunting or scouting party. Many caravans traversing the Path of Aganhei—the trade route between the continents of Avistan and Tian Xia that crosses the Crown of the World—have had their expeditions abruptly ended by an encounter with one of these monstrosities. Those who study monsters posit that umonlees are related to chuuls, as the creatures exhibit some similarities. Both are semi-intelligent, crustacean predators that use ambush tactics to kill and eat their prey. Even though they can talk, umonlees typically only speak Aklo, which also gives credence to this theory. This would also lend to the theory that chuuls are products of alghollthu manipulation, meaning that umonlees are also the results of these alien designs.

This walking corpse is animated by a larval akata attached to the deceased creature's brain, using a grotesque feeding tendril that emerges from the corpse's mouth to drink blood from its victims. A void zombie typically exists for only a few months before it collapses and the larval akata crawls free from the motionless shell. When it feels the natural end of its unlife approaching, a void zombie finds a secluded place to vomit forth the nearly mature akata larva, then withers away. The disgorged larva metamorphizes into a full-grown akata several hours later, usually eating the corpse as its first meal. The name “void zombie” is something of a misnomer; though still compelled by necromantic energies, a void zombie is a host in the life cycle of a parasitic alien, not a mindless, reanimated corpse (despite their similar appearances). The fact that a typical void zombie shares the neutral alignment of the larval akata within, rather than the intrinsically evil nature of other zombies, has caused some scholars to push to reclassify them under other names. Suggestions have included “void dead,” “akata spawn,” or “bloodwalker,” but the visceral and compelling commonplace name has proven difficult to shed. The driving force behind a void zombie's violence rises from the ravenous hunger of the alien parasite that serves as the channel for its animating negative energies. Necromancers have tried often to duplicate the void zombie, but without a larval akata hosted within, the result is simply a zombie with missing jaws or, at best, one that moves faster than normal. Others have compared a captive void zombie to a captive yellow musk thrall in an attempt to discover a potential link between the two— after all, both are animated bodies controlled by a parasitic outside force. Strangely, a void zombie becomes particularly violent when encountering a yellow musk thrall, making direct comparisons of the two creatures particularly difficult, or even dangerous.

Often grouping in committees of four or five, these scavengers wheel above battles and plague-stricken towns, eager to feed. This feeding cycle plays an important role, especially in hot regions, as their particularly potent stomach acid neutralizes dangerous bacteria in their meals and thus removes it from the environment. A giant vulture has a wingspan of up to 25 feet across and weighs up to 600 pounds. Less common than their smaller cousins, they typically live in areas that support a number of megafauna species. While imposing and certainly dangerous when provoked, even giant vultures are not hostile by nature, preferring to feast on the kills of others. They are more likely to vomit their last meal as a distraction while they flee than to attack other creatures. However, during particularly lean times, starving groups of giant vultures might work in unison to make a meal of livestock. Giant vultures occasionally form parasitic relationships with larger creatures such as dragons or giants, picking at the remains of an unattended or forgotten meal. Crafters who use bones in their work have come to value this type of behavior. Flensing a creature properly is far slower than letting a committee of vultures strip the carcass and leave behind a clean skeleton. As food-motivated predators, younger vultures raised this way can be made to imprint upon owners, leading to a trend of keeping them as unusual pets. While not magical in nature, vulture talons are traditionally used as charms in healing and removing disease, stemming from an old belief that the raptors were immune to the filth in which they strode.

They can extinguish their illumination entirely to become invisible, and they enjoy doing so once their victims are wholly lost and have realized that the bobbing light in the distance isn’t, in fact, leading them to safety.

A cowed or defeated will-o’-wisp can be a good source of lore and information, though acquiring such cooperation from such a sinister monster is no easy feat.

They are therefore reluctant to lead victims into immediately fatal areas such as deadfalls, but instead prefer hazards where their victims suffer over a long time, such as pockets of stale or poisonous air, patches of quicksand, and dens of bigger monsters. According to will-o’-wisps, different types of fear have subtle differences in flavor. The lurking dread in the pit of the stomach that gnaws at those who slowly become aware of the fact that they’re lost produces a much different taste than the sudden stark terror of imminent death in the face of a towering monster.

This has led to feral wollipeds around the Kodar mountains in Irrisen that are much more aggressive than their domesticated cousins.

In addition to their collections of esoteric lore, bronze dragons keep treasures associated with the sea, such as beautiful scrimshaw, flawless pearls, and equipment inlaid with mother-of-pearl and abalone shell.Recall Knowledge - Dragon (Arcana): DC 26Young Bronze Dragon","image_url":"","origin":""},{"name":"Young Cloud Dragon","family":"Dragon, Cloud","level":10,"alignment":"Neutral","creature_type":"Dragon, Elemental","size":"Large","traits":["Air","Dragon","Elemental"],"rarity":"Uncommon","id":"Monsters.aspx?ID=624","lore":"Young Cloud DragonAt heart, cloud dragons are wanderers, explorers, and travelers who enjoy nothing more than seeing new lands and meeting unusual creatures. Cloud dragons range in color from light blue to a pale, milky white and have thick, curling horns and rather short snouts. They keep lairs among the extreme altitudes of the highest mountain peaks but are away on their many journeys as often as they're at home. Cloud dragons spend long hours surveying the lands they fly over from great heights, but they are creatures of whim, making it hard to predict what will pique their curiosity and bring them winging down to converse or investigate something on the ground. Cloud dragons seldom perform acts of outright malice, but they are not often charitable either. A cloud dragon is as likely to simply pluck something they desire off the ground and fly away with it as they are to bargain fairly.A cloud dragon's ever-changing interests never seem to stray toward the complicated schemes and long-term plans of other dragons. These rovers are creatures of the moment, and although they are as mentally gifted as other true dragons, their interests remain in the here and now. Yet the cloud dragon's penchant for living in the moment is not a personality flaw—they're more than capable of anticipating long-term results of their actions and won't make foolish choices simply to pursue a current interest. At the same time, cloud dragons have little interest in worrying about the future and are as confident in their ability to handle tomorrow's problems as they are today's.Cloud dragon hoards tend to be well-guarded or well-hidden, as a natural result of their roving habits often taking them away from their lairs for extended periods. Their treasuries include a wide variety of items—they are driven to gather a broad range of prizes rather than collecting one type of item intensively.

Copper dragons are hedonists who are quick to indulge in simple pleasures, but they’re also sympathetic to other creatures, slow to pass judgment, and careful to always examine a situation from as many perspectives as possible. This philosophy has its drawbacks, however, as copper dragons are susceptible to negative influences and prone to forgiving the less serious evil acts performed by their chromatic cousins and other cruel creatures. Copper dragons also have a difficult time keeping their temper in check once they are roused to anger. Copper dragons tend to lair in warm or temperate hills, but due to their nature, they move their lairs every few years. They sometimes live among other people, especially any dwarves who reside nearby. Some copper dragons even worship gods typically worshipped only by humanoids. Among these dragons, worship of Cayden Cailean is most popular, as they see his love of freedom and penchant for alcohol aligning with the typical copper dragon mindset.

Although their opinions are changeable, crystal dragons prefer orderly environments and are not fond of sudden interruptions or distractions.Crystal dragons build their lairs in underground grottoes, where they cultivate environments of great beauty. Their exacting standards and vivid imaginations mean that they are always working to improve the appearance or layout of some part of their lair. These lairs are unique to each individual crystal dragon, but there are always plenty of reflective surfaces that allow the dragon to observe their own appearance. These range from crystals to reflecting pools to finely crafted mirrors, which are arranged throughout the lair in a pleasing array. Gifts of well-crafted or magical mirrors are an excellent way to curry favor with a crystal dragon.Although crystal dragons are easily distracted by their sparkling collections or their vanity, they remain good-hearted creatures at the core and make friends quickly.

They command the unwavering reverence of all other metallic dragons, who view gold dragons as their leaders and counselors. Golds rival the raw power of even red dragons, much to the chagrin of their chromatic cousins, and the two races are often regarded as bitter rivals. But despite their incredible power, gold dragons are fond of discourse and prefer to talk through solutions to problems rather than rely upon brute strength. Long-lived as they are, they necessarily take a wide view of all situations and never act without considering all possible options and outcomes. Because of this, gold dragons willingly converse with any creature that seeks them out, even evil chromatic dragons. Mortals might find this behavior strange, considering the longstanding war between chromatic and metallic dragons, but dragons know all too well that desperate situations sometimes call for drastic alliances. And although gold dragons might consider brief truces with their chromatic brethren in the case of world-ending threats, they also know when such alliances have run their course. When another metallic dragon faces a quandary or a foe beyond its own ability to overcome, its best option is often to seek the counsel of the eternally wise and gloriously righteous gold dragons. Locating these legendary beings is no easy task, however, for gold dragons are notoriously reclusive. Their intellect and wisdom is such that they prefer to ponder the great questions of life in seclusion, where they strive to formulate solutions to the world's most pressing problems. As a result, gold dragons are sometimes absent when metallic dragons gather together, or are missing from tribunals where their counsel would be beneficial. Impatient dragons sometimes begrudge gold dragons for this apparent unreliability, but such aspersions are usually a result of jealousy rather than any true criticism; in their hearts, other dragons know that few gold dragons purposefully exclude themselves from truly important matters. A gold dragon's incredible foresight and unparalleled enlightenment means they are unlikely to interfere in the business of individual mortals, though the rare person who captures the attention of a gold dragon is fortunate indeed, for there are few beings in the cosmos who can offer such prudent and considerate advice. Rulers and individuals in stations of high power have an easier time of garnering the aid of a gold dragon; entire wars have been avoided thanks to a gold dragon's last-minute intermediation. Gold dragons are often found in warm grasslands and savannas, lands where they can enjoy long, meditative flights without attracting the attention of potential enemies. They tend to sleep either out in the open in a barren, remote place, or within a heavily secreted or fortified lair, such as a forgotten sink hole or in the labyrinthine caverns of a terrestrial chasm.

Any careful approach that takes advantage of a green dragon’s fixations may end in a diplomatic outcome, but any misstep or slight can provoke a savage attack. Like most chromatic dragons, green dragons do not suffer fools—and the threshold for what they consider foolish is very low. Though more open than their chromatic cousins to dealing with other creatures and dragons, green dragons prefer an isolated and quiet life. They tend to lair in the most forbidding parts of a forest, surrounded by tangled thickets, or else at the heart of some dismal gulch. If the terrain is suitable, some green dragons make their home in natural caves, which they expand to suit their needs. Green dragons’ pride leads them to see to the preservation of their forest homes. They feel that a verdant and lush forest is something that they alone have cultivated. This leads some green dragons to follow the path of druidism, though most prefer to study the arcane arts and occult lore. Most of them delve deeply into one particular field of study, and correspond with other scholars in the field by adopting a pen name that hides their true nature. Regardless of their chosen focus, green dragons seek to improve themselves, and their desire for knowledge makes them more likely to deal diplomatically with other creatures in order to obtain new information. Their hoards are typically well kept, organized, and filled with tomes of lore and scrolls of magic along with antiquities they collect for their own inscrutable reasons.

Red dragons don’t deign to speak with lesser creatures; they simply dominate and burn, enslaving weaker creatures to act as servants and to look after their lairs while the dragons slumber away. They take pleasure in dominating these creatures, and they demand tribute from their supplicants. Those who anger or disappoint end up eaten or reduced to ash. They command their enslaved minions to constantly build onto their lairs, carving out new tunnels and designing cunning traps that ensure the dragon’s security.

Their somewhat humanoid faces feature bulging black eyes, dark fur, and pointed fangs, shocking—if not terrifying—those who get a glimpse of them scuttling along a roof or peeping out from under an eave. Sensitive creatures, zrukbats quickly learn that their appearance triggers negative reactions, yet they prefer to live in urban settlements, observing busy streets and houses from inconspicuous locations. Zrukbats hide in plain sight using their shapeshifting abilities to mimic a broad repertoire of objects. Despite their intelligence, they fundamentally don't understand others' reasoning and often make foolish mistakes in their disguises. For example, one might shapeshift into a lit lantern in an otherwise abandoned house, misjudge the pattern of roof ornaments and become an out-of-place spire, or disguise themself as smoke in an unlit chimney. Due to their fearsome appearance and predisposition to conceal themselves, zrukbats are associated with ghosts and other supernatural phenomena. This affiliation isn't wholly earned; as long as zrukbats feel they've gone unnoticed, they remain generally peaceful. When their obsessive secrecy fails, they devolve into extremely volatile, dangerous creatures.

A zuipnyrn’s body is particularly soft and malleable, allowing it to withstand falls and other hazards. Its eye stalk has the ability to produce a blinding burst of light as a defensive measure, which allows a zuipnyrn just enough time to escape in times of danger. Even more incredibly, a zuipnyrn can emit a hypnotic aura from its eye to entrance those around it—an ability it uses to avoid conflict and to persuade bystanders into helping it escape perilous situations.

He was quick to realize that his fellows weren't carrying out their tasks as efficiently as they could be, and his efforts to organize his tribe more effectively always seemed to fail. It was only after investigating that he realized how much the Yioxats were deliberately undermining his efforts, as they despised their devil overlord, and despised Urok by association.  Though he was heavily tempted to double down on his attempts to control, Urok instead fled, hiding in the wilderness as he tried to make sense of his life until this point. It was there that a Yioxat dragon sorcerer found him. The sorcerer explained that the Yioxat tribe had warded Urok's egg against evil influence before he was born, to protect him from the risk of Hell claiming his soul.

Though he doesn't want to approach his fellows just yet, he keeps watch over them, looking for an opportunity to kill the devil and free his family.
